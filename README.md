# Wait, GitHub?

---

## I thought that was for Coders

- Jenn has been introducing it to Communications, Designers, BAs, Data Analysts

---

## Or just a place to store stuff

- If it was only that I’d be telling you to use Google Drive
- But it’s a tool for collaboration

---

# Collaboration = Destroying Silos


---

# Silo One: Yourself

- The most important, and maybe surprising, silo is yourself.

## You last week/month/year is not the you of today

## Your Team
- You all work on the same team, but you’re still individuals. Silos can form.
- Readmes
	- GitHub puts a text file, named Readme, front and center.
	- Simple setup directions, explanations of what this thing does.
- Wikis
	- If a single readme is not enough, you can host a whole Wiki
- Pull Requests & Reviews
	- When someone wants to change something, you can give the team a chance to review and comment
---

## Your Department
- Your team is communicating well, now it’s time to break down the silo that separates you from the rest of your department
- You want a pretty web page to tell everyone about one of your projects, or your team
	- Pages
- Maybe there’s the one BA over in a different office who knows a lot about X
	- Teams!
- Maybe the director wants to see how much progress you’re making towards Y
	- Projects & Milestones

## Your University

	- Releases
	- Announce the changes

	- Hear about their new stuff
	- Or they can hear about what you’re up to!
