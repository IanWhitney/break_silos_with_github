## Your Team
- You all work on the same team, but you’re still individuals. Silos can form.
- Readmes
	- GitHub puts a text file, named Readme, front and center.
	- Simple setup directions, explanations of what this thing does.
- Wikis
	- If a single readme is not enough, you can host a whole Wiki
- Pull Requests & Reviews
	- When someone wants to change something, you can give the team a chance to review and comment
---

## Your Department
- Your team is communicating well, now it’s time to break down the silo that separates you from the rest of your department
- You want a pretty web page to tell everyone about one of your projects, or your team
	- Pages
- Maybe there’s the one BA over in a different office who knows a lot about X
	- Teams!
- Maybe the director wants to see how much progress you’re making towards Y
	- Projects & Milestones
---

## Your University
- Releasing your work to the world
	- Releases
	- Announce the changes
	- Give others a chance to use your work
- Watches_Stars_Following Users
	- Connect with other people at the U that do work you like
	- Hear about their new stuff
	- Or they can hear about what you’re up to!
- Learn more
	- lunch
	- github docs
