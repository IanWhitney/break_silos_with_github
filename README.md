^Or, maybe you think it's just a place to store stuff
^If it was only that I’d be telling you to use Google Drive
^But it’s a tool for collaboration

# TBD: Transition

^ Something to move us to types of silos and relevant GitHub tools

---

> Using GitHub to answer, "Why?"

^ The value of this message is up to you.

---

![](placeholder.jpg)

^ You can leave your self a cryptic message devoid of any context

---

^ Or you can explain what you were thinking
^ And what future you should keep in mind before changing things again

## Your Team
- You all work on the same team, but you’re still individuals. Silos can form.
- Readmes
	- GitHub puts a text file, named Readme, front and center.
	- Simple setup directions, explanations of what this thing does.
- Wikis
	- If a single readme is not enough, you can host a whole Wiki
- Pull Requests & Reviews
	- When someone wants to change something, you can give the team a chance to review and comment
---

## Your Department
- Your team is communicating well, now it’s time to break down the silo that separates you from the rest of your department
- You want a pretty web page to tell everyone about one of your projects, or your team
	- Pages
- Maybe there’s the one BA over in a different office who knows a lot about X
	- Teams!
- Maybe the director wants to see how much progress you’re making towards Y
	- Projects & Milestones
